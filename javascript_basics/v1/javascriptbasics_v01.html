                <p>Javascript Basics</p>
                <p> Javascript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. 
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                    It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibilty for develpers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web
                    broswer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                <p>
                    <li><a href="url">Variable Declaration</a>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                        the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. 
                    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unigque names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;

                    </li>
                <p>
                    <li><a href="url"> Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - 
                        our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                    The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x = 10;</span>
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><a href="url">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to kow the data type. 
                        There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean 
                        - <span>true </span>or false, null - <span> null </span>aka nothing; Number - <span>42 </span>or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"; 

                        </span>Array - {1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'}; and Object - <span> {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe"} </span>
                    </li>
                </p>
                    <li><a href="url">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks 
                        based on values or conditions that have been met. 
                        You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: 
                        <span>if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span>else if </span>to specifiy a new condition to test,
                        if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><a href="url">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
                        they will repeat an action some number of times. 
                        Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    </li>
                </p>    
                <p>
                    <li><a href="url">Function</a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. 
                        Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual 
                        and get started, first we screew the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. 
                        Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
